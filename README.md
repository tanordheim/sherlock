## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To run the Sherlock Launcher, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)

Additionally, if you're building from source, you will need:

- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

### Installation

#### <ins>Arch Linux</ins>

If you're using Arch Linux, you can install the pre-built binary package with the following command:

```bash
yay -S sherlock-launcher-bin
```

#### <ins>From Source</ins>

To build Sherlock Launcher from source, follow these steps.<br>
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/skxxtz/sherlock.git
    cd sherlock
    ```

2. **Install necessary Rust dependencies**:

    Build the project using the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. **Install the binary**:

    After the build completes, install the binary to your system:

    ```bash
    sudo cp target/release/sherlock /usr/bin/
    ```

#### <ins>Build Debian Package</ins>

To build a `.deb` package directly from the source, follow these steps:<br>
Make sure you have the folloing dependencies installed:
- `rust` - [How to install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `git` - [How to install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- `gtk4` - [Gtk4 Documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/)
- `gtk-4-layer-shell` - [Gtk4 Layer Shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell)

1. **Install the `cargo-deb` tool**:

    First, you need to install the `cargo-deb` tool, which simplifies packaging Rust projects as Debian packages:

    ```bash
    cargo install cargo-deb
    ```

2. **Build the Debian package**:

    After installing `cargo-deb`, run the following command to build the `.deb` package:

    ```bash
    cargo deb
    ```

    This will create a `.deb` package in the `target/debian` directory.

3. **Install the generated `.deb` package**:

    Once the package is built, you can install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i target/debian/sherlock-launcher_0.1.0_amd64.deb
    ```

    (Make sure to replace the filename if the version number is different.)

After installation, you can enjoy using Sherlock Launcher, which will handle dependencies and installation automatically!
