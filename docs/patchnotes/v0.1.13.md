## Minor Features

### Multi-Selection for Piped Content

You can now use the `--multi` flag to enable multi selection

### Piping for Daemon-Mode

You can now pipe content into Sherlock when running in daemonized mode.

### Improved Cache Invalidation

Sherlock now checks for changed made to the .desktop files.

### Added Theme Selector

```json
{
    "name": "Theme Picker",
    "type": "theme_picker",
    "args": {
        "location": "~/.config/sherlock/themes/"
    },
    "priority": 4,
    "home": true
}
```

> **💡 Note:** It's probably a good idea to wrap this into a category launcher.

### Added Currency Calculator Capability

You can now use the `calc.currencies` capability on the clipboard and calculator launcher to display results for currency transformations.

### Animations are Back

The previously deprecated config key `animate = <bool>` is now back!

### Photo Flag

Since Sherlock now closes whenever it looses focus, it's difficult to take screenshots of it. This is now possible again by starting it with the `--photo` flag.

### First API Efforts for Plugin Support

The groundwork for adding plugins support is now set. The idea is to send messages over a socket server to Sherlock. These messages are in JSON format and get deserialized and interpreted by Sherlock. This allows for consistency in the design choices and integration from every programming language. It is also planned to make a custom lib for rust that simplifies the handling with said API. The next step is the integration of more API functions.
