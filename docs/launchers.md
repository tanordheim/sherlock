# Launchers

In the Sherlock Application Launcher, each tile is associated with a specific "launcher." You can think of a launcher as a category to which tiles belong. For example, if a launcher is set to invisible, all tiles under that launcher will also be invisible.<br>

Launchers are defined in the `fallback.json` file located in your config directory (`/home/user/.config/sherlock/`). If the application cannot find your configuration, it will fallback to the default configuration, which is stored in [fallback.json](resources/fallback.json).<br>

> **Example File:** [fallback.json](https://github.com/Skxxtz/sherlock/blob/main/docs/examples/fallback.json)
<br>

The launcher can be of the following types:<br>

- **[App Launcher](#app-launcher):** Launches your apps. 
- **[Web Launcher](#web-launcher):** Opens the ``{keyword}`` in your default webbrowser. The used search engine is configureable and the most common search engines are included. 
- **[Calculator](#calculator):** Converts your input into a math equation and displays its result. On Return, it also copies the result into the clipboard.
- **[Clipboard Launcher](#clipboard-launcher):** Checks if your clipboard currently holds a URL. On Return, it opens the url in the default webbrowser. Also displays hex and rgb colors.
- **[Command](#command-launcher):** This field can execute commands that do not rely on the ``{keyword}`` attribute (such as connecting to a specific wifi).
- **[Bulk Text](#bulk-text):** The Bulk Text is a way to launch a custom script/application in an async form and to display its result in a widget.
- **[Teams Event Launcher](#teams-event):** This launcher is capable of joining Microsoft Teams meetings that are scheduled to begin between 5mins ago and in 15mins. 
- **[Music Player Launcher](#music-player):** This launcher shows the currently playing song with artist and toggles playback on return.

## Common Launcher Attributes

| `args`      | `[FC]` (required) | Arguments specific to the `type`. Can be left empty. |
